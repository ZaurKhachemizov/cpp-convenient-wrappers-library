C++ convenient wrappers library is a free open source library for C++ programming language. The library helps to increase development speed, to make programs more stable and scalable, to make code neater and shorter, and allows to avoid unnecessary relations and code duplications.

Usage:
Include header files you need from ./csw folder depending on what parts of the library you want to use.
Below you will find lists of compilers, standards, and third-party libraries' versions the library tested with. The library is cross-platform and supports a number of standards and third-party libraries' versions but when using it in untested conditions, some fixes may be necessary.

For now, no build toolchain for tests is provided.To build anduse tests you need to build andrun ./tests/tests.cpp using build toolchain you need.Also, you need to build.cpp files from ./examples/... so each app and corresponding.txt file will be located in the tests' working directory.
